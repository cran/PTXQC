**This package allows users of MaxQuant to generate quality control reports in Html/PDF format.**

### Features
  - plethora of quality metrics
    - intensity distributions
    - digestion efficiency
    - contaminant visualizations
    - identification performance
    - Match-between-runs performance
  - easy usage ([Windows OS only] `drag'n'drop` your `txt output folder` onto a `batch file`)
    - 10 min installation, see [drag'n'drop] [1]
  - Html/PDF report will be generated within your txt folder
  - optional configuration file *in YAML format* for generation of shorter/customized reports

### Target audience
  - MaxQuant users (no knowledge of R required)
  - bioinformaticians (who want to contribute or customize)

  
### Latest changes / Change log

See [NEWS][News_File] file.

### Documentation
  
Besides this documentation on GitHub, the package vignettes
of PTXQC will give you valuable information. *After* the package is installed (see below),
you can browse the vignettes using either of these commands within R:

    help(package="PTXQC")
    browseVignettes(package = 'PTXQC')
  
If you do not want to wait that long, have a look at the ['vignettes' subfolder] [3].
The top part contains a small table with technical gibberish, but the rest is identical to the
vignettes you would see in R.

You will find documentation on
  - Input and Output
  - Report customization
  - (for MaxQuant users) Usage of Drag'n'drop
  - (for R users) code examples in R
  - ...
  
### Installation

**If you want to generate QC reports without actually getting involved in R:**

We offer a Batch-file based Drag'n'drop mechanism to trigger PTXQC on any MaxQuant output folder.
This only works for Windows (not Linux or MacOS) at the moment -- but you have a Windows anyway to run MaxQuant, right?!
See [drag'n'drop] [1] for details. It takes 10 minutes and you are done!

**If you just want the package to use (and maybe even modify) it:**

First, install [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases). Pandoc is required in order to build the package vignettes (documentation) and PTXQC reports in HTML format.
In theory you can skip vignette building (see below) and read the [vignettes] [Ref_Vign] online from the PTXQC GitHub page.
The reports can also be configured to be printed as PDF instead of HTML, but HTML just looks nicer and is interactive.
**If you install Pandoc later while your R session is already open, you need to close and re-open R in order to make R aware of Pandoc!**
   
The following lines will install the PTXQC package.
Direct installation from GitHub requires the 'devtools' package.
Run **each line** separately in your R console, i.e. do not copy and paste the whole block.
If an error should occur, this allows to track it down more easily. See [FAQ - Installation] [Ref_VignFAQ]
how to resolve them.
   
    if (!require(devtools, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")             ## this might give a warning like 'WARNING: Rtools is required ...'. Ignore it.
    install_github("cbielow/PTXQC", build_vignettes = TRUE)    ## use build_vignettes = FALSE if you did not install pandoc!
    
To get started, see the help and/or vignettes:

    help(package="PTXQC")
    browseVignettes(package = 'PTXQC')

Please feel free to report bugs (see below), or issue pull requests!    
    
### Platform support

  - Windows (recommended for convenience to make use of the [drag'n'drop] [1] batch file provided)
  - Linux
  - MacOSX

### Bug reporting / Feature requests

If you encounter a bug, e.g. error message, wrong figures, missing axis annotation or anything which looks
suspicious, please use the [GitHub issue tracker] [issuetracker] and file a report.

You should include
  - **stage** you encounter the bug, e.g. during installation, report creation, or after report creation (i.e. a bug in the report itself).
  - **PDF/Html report** itself (if one was generated).
  - **version of PTXQC**, e.g. see the report_XXX.pdf/html (where XXX will be the version) or see the DESCRIPTION file of the PTXQC package or call `help(package="PTXQC")` within R
  - **error message** (very important!). Either copy it or provide a screen shot.

Please be as precise as possible when providing the bug report - just imagine what kind of information you would like to have in order
to track down the issue.
In certain situations, the whole txt-folder or a single MaxQuant file might be helpful to solve the problem.

If you want to see a new metric, or have ideas how to improve the existing ones, just open an issue ticket and leave a description.
  
### Report Examples

An overview chart at the beginning of the report will give you a first impression.

Detailed plots can be found in the remainder of each report.

For example input data and full reports, see the ['inst/examples' subfolder] [2].
