#' Quality metric for 'centeredness' of a distribution around zero.
#' 
#' Ranges between 0 (worst score) and 1 (best score).
#' A median of zero gives the best score of 1.
#' The closer the median is to the most extreme value of the distribution, the smaller the score (until reaching 0).
#' Can be used for calibrated mass errors, as a measure of how well they are centered around 0.

#' Ranges between 0 (worst score) and 1 (best score).
