#' If the file has the param, then return it as string.
#' If the file is missing, warning is shown and NULL is returned.
#' If the param (i.e. XML tag) is unknown or cannot be extracted, the program will quit (since this is a hard error).
#' When multiple occurrences of the param are found (usually due to parameter groups), we test if the values are all identical.
#' If so, the value is returned. If the values are different, a warning is emitted and NULL is returned unless 'allow_multiple = TRUE'
#' 
#' E.g. calling getMQPARValue("mqpar.xml", "//firstSearchTol")
#' will look up the line
#' <firstSearchTol>20</firstSearchTol>
#' and return "20" (string!).

#' @param allow_multiple If the XPath expression returns more than one value, all values must be identical (not allowing multiple different values) or 'stop()' is called
#' 
#' @return The stored value as string(!)
