you can reduce the fragment mass tolerance to obtain more 
identifications under the same FDR. On the other hand, if the fragment mass errors are not centered on 
zero, a recalibration of the instrument should be performed.
If the (Gaussian-like) distribution is cut too severely on either side by the search tolerance window in MaxQuant,
you might be able to increase the number of identifications by allowing for a wider MS/MS search window when re-running MaxQuant.
However, the number of decoy identifications will increase as well, potentially offsetting any gain when FDR is applied.

      "Under optimal digestion conditions (high enzyme grade etc.), only few missed cleavages (MC) are expected. In 
general, increased MC counts also increase the number of peptide signals, thus cluttering the available 
space and potentially provoking overlapping peptide signals, biasing peptide quantification.
Thus, low MC counts should be favored. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that 
incorporation of peptides with missed cleavages does not negatively influence protein quantification (see 
[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr500294d](Chiva, C., Ortega, M., and Sabido, E. Influence of the Digestion Technique, Protease, and Missed 
Cleavage Peptides in Protein Quantitation. J. Proteome Res. 2014, 13, 3979-86) ). 
However this is true only if all samples show the same degree of digestion. High missed cleavage values 
can indicate for example, either a) failed digestion, b) a high (post-digestion) protein contamination, or 
c) a sample with high amounts of unspecifically degraded peptides which are not digested by trypsin. 

If MC>=1 is high (>20%) you should increase the missed cleavages settings in MaxQuant and compare the number of peptides.
Usually high MC correlates with bad identification rates, since many spectra cannot be matched to the forward database.

In the rare case that 'no enzyme' was specified in MaxQuant, neither scores nor plots are shown.
