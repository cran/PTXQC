\title{Find longest common substring from 'n' strings.}
\usage{
LCSn(strings, min_LCS_length = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{strings}{A vector of strings in which to search for LCS}

\item{min_LCS_length}{Minimum length expected. Empty string is returned if the result is shorter}
}
\value{
longest common substring (or "" if shorter than \code{min_LCS_length})
}
\description{
Warning: heuristic! This is not guaranteed to find the best solution, since its done pairwise with the shortest input string as reference.
}
\examples{
LCSn(c("1_abcde...", "2_abcd...", "x_abc..."))  ## result: "_abc"

}
