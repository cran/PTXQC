  - reduce memory footprint (~50% reduction; replacing ddply() with data.table[])

v0.80.1 -- 2016/03/15
  - experimental missing value metric (on peptide level)
    - density plots (showing what intensities are usually missing)
      - includes simple inter-Raw file normalization scheme
    - percentage of missing values (lower is better) -- used for scoring in heatmap
    
v0.80.0 -- 2016/02
  - Report format is by default now Html and PDF (you get two identical reports)
